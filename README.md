# üêò Elephant
Docker orchestrator project üêò.

I'm using the Docker SDK for this. 

## The concept

Elephants are big. And solid. And they're great.

So they can carry several containers.
For that, they need to eat a docker-compose like file. But it can be named the way you want (even something like `cool.yml` it's up to you).

You also gotta tell them to start and carry them, using the command `walk`.

Elephants are so so great that there are other commands they understand :)

## Install

You can either :
- Run `go get -u github.com/applinh/elephant`
- Or clone the repo, cd inside it and run `go install github.com/applinh/elephant`

## Commands

- `walk`: Start a stack using a compose file. The CLI will also ask you to name your elephant, this is important.
    - `-f` : Specify the past to your compose file
    - `-e` : Specify the elephant name. If you don't specify any, the CLI will ask you to specify one in interactive mode
- `ls`: List the elephants and the containers they carry.
- `stomp`: Your elephant will drop and stomp on all the containers he carries (in a short way, it stops the containers associated to your elephant).
    - You have to add an addition argument, which is the name of your elephant

## Examples

- `elephant walk -f ~/garbageDir/cool.yml` or `elephant walk -f ./cool.yml` (eventually `elephant walk -f ./cool.yml -e myboi` if you want to directly specify the elephant name)
- `elephant stomp myStack`
- `elephant ls`

I'd recommend to set your GOPATH env variable and then run `go install github.com/applinh/elephant` so you can directly use the `elephant` command anywhere.
